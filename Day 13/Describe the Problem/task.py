my_function()

# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
# The for loop is running 20 times
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
# Once i = 20
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
# That it will reach 20. But it only goes up to (and not including 20).
